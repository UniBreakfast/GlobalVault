# [GLobalVault](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/GlobalVault)

### A constructor/class to make easily saveable/loadable state object.

`GlobalVault` class allows to create instances that can at any point in times save/load data structures stored in global variables with default of custom storages. Examples are using Local Storage or JSON files accessed with `fs` module on Node.js back end, but really any storage idea can be easily implemented.

If limited to front end storage like Local Storage it can be used without the back end part.
